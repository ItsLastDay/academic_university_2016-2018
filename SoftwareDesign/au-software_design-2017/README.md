# Software Design

Homework for "Software Design" course. I spent a lot of time trying to come up with high-quality code: with documentation, tests, logging, code coverage and reasonable architecture. My biggest achievement is a rogue-like game.

Each folder is a separate task:
- simple rogue-like [game](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/tree/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/roguelike). You can actually play it! With [documentation](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/tree/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/roguelike/docs), [design-document](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/roguelike/docs/design-doc.md) and [architecture](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/roguelike/rougelike.vpp);
- [command-line interface](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/tree/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/cli): think of a small `bash` written in Python 3. With [documentation](http://au-software-design-2017.readthedocs.io/en/grep/), good architectural decomposition and tests;
- extremely simple [protobuf- and grpc-based chat](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/tree/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/chat/src);
- [architecture](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/tree/master/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/bookstore) for imaginary electronic book store (based on teacher-provided requirements).
