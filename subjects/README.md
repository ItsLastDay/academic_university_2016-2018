Subjects presented in this repo (with links to more thorough README-s and some highlights):
- [C++](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/C%2B%2B/README.md): learned *a lot* about C++, implemented thread pool, big integer library, boost::any;
- [Operating Systems](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/OperatingSystems/README.md): wrote basic Linux kernel based on QEMU. I'm proud that I worked with interrupts, virtual memory mapping and other sorts of
low-level things. I implemented buddy allocator, slab allocator, malloc and a small filesystem;
- [Software Design](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/README.md): wrote a lot of code with well-thought architecture, documentation, logging, tests and code coverage. Compared to other subjects, this one contains only two projects, but they are rather big and self-contained;
- [Databases](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Databases/README.md): implemented half of a small one-columnar relational database (another half was written as a stub by our teacher), featuring *Volcano* architecture, histograms and various `join` operations (hash join, merge join, nested loop join);
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/MachineLearning/README.md): implemented several classification (Decision tree, perceptron, naive bayes, KNN), clustering (affinity propagation, DBSCAN, K-means), regression (linear, ridge) and other algorithms;
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Algorithms/README.md): implemented and applied various algorithms and data structures. Among them: Quad Tree, Treap, Trie, Fast Fourier Transformation, Suffix Array, shortest path algorithms, Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding maxflow in a graph;
- [Java](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Java/assignments-2017-1/README.md): implemented couple of data structures, played with reflection and functional programming aspects;
- [Bash and Python](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Bash%26Python/README.md): learned metaclasses and decorators in Python, wrote a lot of bash scripts;
- [Formal languages](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/FormalLanguages/formal_languages/README.md): implemented several theoretic algorithms (non-deterministic finite automata to determenistic finite automata; Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm; variation of Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm for parsing graphs), used ANTLR4 to parse simple programming language;
- [Haskell](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Haskell/README.md): dived into the world of functional programming, worked with a couple of things (including applicative functors, monads, lenses);
- Idris: wrote a couple of tasks using functional language with dependent types - Idris. Highlight: *very* simple [database](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Idris/idris-spb-assignment-1-ItsLastDay/part%203/datastore.idr);
