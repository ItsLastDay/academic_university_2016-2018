Subjects presented in this repo (with links to more thorough README-s and some highlights):

## Programming languages
- [C++](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/C%2B%2B/README.md): learned *a lot* about C++, implemented thread pool, big integer library, boost::any;
- [Java](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Java): implemented console torrent client and tracker, ftp server, couple of data structures; played with reflection and functional programming aspects;
- [Bash and Python](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Bash%26Python/README.md): learned metaclasses and decorators in Python, wrote a lot of bash scripts;
- [Haskell](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Haskell/README.md): dived into the world of functional programming, worked with a couple of things (including applicative functors, monads, lenses);
- Idris: wrote a couple of tasks using functional language with dependent types - Idris. Highlight: *very* simple [database](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Idris/idris-spb-assignment-1-ItsLastDay/part%203/datastore.idr);

## Low-level programming
- [Operating Systems](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/OperatingSystems/README.md): wrote basic Linux kernel based on QEMU. I'm proud that I worked with interrupts, virtual memory mapping and other sorts of
low-level things. I implemented buddy allocator, slab allocator, malloc and a small filesystem;
- [Programming in Linux kernel](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/au-linux-kernel-autumn-2017/blob/master/README.md): implemented driver for virtual storage device (the hardest task was about asynchronous and non-blocking IO); implemented futex.
- [Databases](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Databases/README.md): implemented half of a small one-columnar relational database (another half was written as a stub by our teacher), featuring *Volcano* architecture, histograms and various `join` operations (hash join, merge join, nested loop join);
- [Virtual machines](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/VirtualMachines/mathvm/README.md): implemented bytecode emitter and translator for a simple programming language;


## Software engineering
- [Software Design](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/SoftwareDesign/au-software_design-2017/README.md): wrote a lot of code with well-thought architecture, documentation, logging, tests and code coverage. Compared to other subjects, this one contains only two projects, but they are rather big and self-contained;
- [Parallel Programming](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/tree/master/subjects/ParallelProgramming): implemented lock-free set, played with Pthread API and OpenCL;

## Big data
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/MachineLearning/README.md): implemented several classification (Decision tree, perceptron, naive bayes, KNN), clustering (affinity propagation, DBSCAN, K-means), regression (linear, ridge) and other algorithms;
- [Deep Learning](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/au_dl_course/blob/master/README.md): implemented several popular models using Tensorflow (object detection, embeddings, VAE, ...);
- [Big Data](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/BigData/README.md): worked with Hadoop (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, HBase) and Spark in a near-real-life manner;


## Theoretical courses
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/Algorithms/README.md): implemented and applied various algorithms and data structures. Among them: Quad Tree, Treap, Trie, Fast Fourier Transformation, Suffix Array, shortest path algorithms, Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding maxflow in a graph;
- [Formal languages](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/subjects/FormalLanguages/formal_languages/README.md): implemented several theoretic algorithms (non-deterministic finite automata to determenistic finite automata; Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm; variation of Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm for parsing graphs), used ANTLR4 to parse simple programming language;


## Unlisted (courses without much code)
I also studied Foundations of Software Engineering, Combinatorics, Mathematical Logic, Interface Design, Information Retrieval (there is one project about it in this repo), English and Deutsch.
