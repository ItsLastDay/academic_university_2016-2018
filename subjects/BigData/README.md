# YandexDataAnalysisSchool Big Data course

This course was about processing big data in near-real-life circumstances. We were given Twitter-like "social network" logs, 
lots of Gb per day. The tasks were about counting some statistics over the data: 
- how many visitors;
- visitors per country;
- how many likes this user has;
- how many sessions were made;
- etc.

I learned several tools:
- `hw1` - MapReduce;
- `hw2` - Spark <-- my favourite!;
- `hw3` - Spark + HBase;
- `hw4` - Hive (although I was exhausted by then).
