# Functional programming with Haskell

Wrote quite a few functions in Haskell. Used monads, monoids, functors, applicative functors (+ parser combinators), lenses, ... .  
Final [task](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Haskell/coursework.hs) was to implement simple untyped lambda-calculus:
with beta-reduction, producing normal form, checking alpha-equivalence.
