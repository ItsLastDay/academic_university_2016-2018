Part 3

In this assignment you have to implement simple database
as a vector of tuples.

Database schema is a description of a tuple for storing data in the
database --- string representation and data type.

Main goals:
1) Building tuple type from given schema.
2) Building tuple value from user input and storing it in the database.
3) Extracting tuple value by its ID and showing it to the user.
4) Processing user commands: setting schema, storing data, extracting
data.

Tasks:
1. Implement all holes in datastore.idr.
2. Add support for storing values of type Bool.
3. Add support for clearing datastore content.
4. Modify the get command so that, if given no arguments, it prints the entire
contents of the data store.
