# Showcase of my code during pursuing Master's degree at SPb AU.

Code that I wrote during pursuing Master's degree at Saint-Petersburg Academic University in 2016-2018. 
The repository is split into two parts: subjects and projects. 

`Projects` are big chunks of code that perform useful work or were very hard to write. I can highlight [Kotlin Fuzzer](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/KotlinFuzzer) - a fuzzer for Kotlin compiler that found many bugs in it. I designed and implemented the fuzzer.

`Subjects` are all subjects that I studied (C++, Java, Databases, Machine Learning, Linux kernel, etc.). They contain a lot of code as well, but tasks inside the subject are more or less independent.
