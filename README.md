# Showcase of my code during pursuing Master's degree at SPb AU.

Code that I wrote during pursuing Master's degree at Saint-Petersburg Academic University in 2016-2018. 
This does not include projects (TODO: add links).

Subjects (with links to more thorough README-s and some highlights):
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Algorithms/README.md): implemented and applied various algorithms and data structures. Among them: Quad Tree, Treap, Trie, Fast Fourier Transformation, Suffix Array, shortest path algorithms, Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding maxflow in a graph;
- [Bash and Python](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Bash%26Python/README.md): learned metaclasses and decorators in Python, wrote a lot of bash scripts;
- [C++](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/C%2B%2B/README.md): learned *a lot* about C++, implemented thread pool, big integer library, boost::any;
- [Databases](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Databases/README.md): implemented half of a small one-columnar relational database, featuring *Volcano* architecture, histograms and various `join` operations (hash join, merge join, nested loop join);
