# Showcase of my code during pursuing Master's degree at SPb AU.

Code that I wrote during pursuing Master's degree at Saint-Petersburg Academic University in 2016-2018. 

Subjects (with links to more thorough README and some highlights):
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Algorithms/README.md): implemented and applied various algorithms and data structures. Among them: Quad Tree, Treap, Trie, Fast Fourier Transformation, Suffix Array, shortest path algorithms, Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding maxflow in a graph.
