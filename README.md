# Showcase of my code during pursuing Master's degree at SPb AU.

Code that I wrote during pursuing Master's degree at Saint-Petersburg Academic University in 2016-2018. 
This does not include several projects that have dedicated repositories:
- [StackOverflow Map](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/StackOverflow_Map): visualization of tags of popular website StackOverflow. You can look at the result [here](https://tag-map.github.io/);
- [Cheat program for Minesweeper](https://github.com/lesya-tishencko/Cheat-program): implemented program for one instance of Minesweeper game, so that it scans memory of the game and marks all mines;
- [Maze generator written in Idris](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/idris-a-mazing): implemented simple program in functional programming language with dependent types;
- [Pip install](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/PipInstall): attempt to predict "truthfulness" of user reviews in e-shops.

Subjects presented in this repo (with links to more thorough README-s and some highlights):
- [C++](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/C%2B%2B/README.md): learned *a lot* about C++, implemented thread pool, big integer library, boost::any;
- [Databases](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Databases/README.md): implemented half of a small one-columnar relational database (another half was written as a stub by our teacher), featuring *Volcano* architecture, histograms and various `join` operations (hash join, merge join, nested loop join);
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Algorithms/README.md): implemented and applied various algorithms and data structures. Among them: Quad Tree, Treap, Trie, Fast Fourier Transformation, Suffix Array, shortest path algorithms, Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding maxflow in a graph;
- [Java](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Java/assignments-2017-1/README.md): implemented couple of data structure, played with reflection and functional programming aspects;
- [Bash and Python](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Bash%26Python/README.md): learned metaclasses and decorators in Python, wrote a lot of bash scripts;
- [Formal languages](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/FormalLanguages/formal_languages/README.md): implemented several theoretic algorithms (non-deterministic finite automata to determenistic finite automata; Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm; variation of Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm for parsing graphs), used ANTLR4 to parse simple programming language;
- [Haskell](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Haskell/README.md): dived into the world of functional programming, tried a couple of things (including applicative functors, monads, lenses);
- Idris: wrote a couple of tasks using functional language with dependent types - Idris. Highlight: *very* simple [database](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/academic_university_2016-2018/blob/master/Idris/idris-spb-assignment-1-ItsLastDay/part%203/datastore.idr);
